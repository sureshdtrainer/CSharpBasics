     * Inheritance -
     * Inheritance can be defined as the process in which one object acquires
     * the properties of other.
     * By Inheritance the information becomes more manageable and in hierarchical order.
     * In other words we can say that inheritance is the relationship between
     * super class (Base / Parent) and sub class (Derived / Child)
     * 
     * Types: - 
     * 1. Single level inheritance - BaseClass --> Derived Class - It is the type of
     * Inheritance in which there is one Base Class and One Derived class
     * 2. Hierarchical inheritance - In this type of inheritance there are multiple derived classes
     * from one Base Class (Parent)
     * 3. Multilevel Inheritance
     * 4. Multiple Inheritance (possible only through Interfaces)
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Polymorphism - Overloading, Overriding
     * Abstract classes, Interfaces
     * Encapsulation - Data hiding, Absraction
     * Getter and setters
     * Constructors, This Keyword
