         * Polymorphism - Same name + Multiple form (Actions / Behavior)
         * 
         * Types of Poly:
         * 
         * 1. Compile time / early binding / static binding / Overloading
         * Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods
         * with the same name but different parameters These methods can differ in
         * the number of parameters, the type of parameters, or both. Method overloading
         * is a form of polymorphism that helps to define multiple behaviors for a method
         * based on the input parameters
         * 2. Runtime Polymorphism / Late binding / Dynamic binding / Overriding
         * different classes (with inheritance applied) we have methods with same
         * signature 
         * 
         * Early binding
         * Late binding
         * static binding
         * Dynamic binding
         * 
         * Abstract Methods - A method which is declared abstract and does not have any body
         * Abstract class
         * 1. We cannot create an object of Abstract class
         * 2. An Abstract class can also contains Non-Abstract methods
         * 3. We can create Constructors inside an Abstract class
         * Interface
         * Multiple Inheritance
         *
